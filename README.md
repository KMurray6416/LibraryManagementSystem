# Library Management System

Welcome to the Library Management System! This project is designed to help manage library resources efficiently and effectively using modular, OOP principles.
Encapsulation principles have also been applied by defining private attributes and using getters and setters for necessary data access.
Separate modules for classes, user interactions, and error handling have been established.
User inputs are well placed all throughout the code to let the user interact with the program every step of the way. All the user has to do is follow the prompts!
I have implemented error handling where applicable using try, except, else, and finally blocks to manage potential issues gracefully, such as incorrect user input.

## Features

- **User Management**: Add, update, and delete user profiles.
- **Book Management**: Add, update, and remove books from the inventory.
- **Borrowing System**: Track which users have borrowed which books.
- **Return Management**: Manage the return of borrowed books and update records accordingly.
- **Search Functionality**: Easily search for books and users.
